# What is Prototon Bot?

PrototonBot is the successor to ShepherdBot Classic, a Discord Bot written by [Donovan Laws](https://github.com/donovanlaws).
The previous bot had been written in JavaScript and was later rewritten and improved in 2020 in C# with Discord.Net.
The old bot has been since discontinued and is now being completely revised and renewed as of 2022, using everything I've learned about programming so far.
I've also been taking an Engineering course at Thinkful and have learned a lot about JavaScript and Front-End and Back-End development, but that's not quite related to this bot.

# How to build Prototon Bot

## Notice
Please be careful when building this project and follow the instructions accordingly as they are listed. Every build here is considered "functional and tested".
It may be best to only download the source code or compiled bot from the *Releases* tab, as main branch still undergoes changes and updates.
**I nor any co-developers will assist or support developing, building, or hosting your modified bot.**
The time, people, and resources to do this are unavailable. Follow the instructions below!

### Requirements
Before building this bot and setting it up, you're going to need these requirements.
- .NET is required for this bot to compile. Version 5.0.x is used in production: [Download Here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)
- MongoDB is required for this bot to operate. Version 4.4.x is used in production: [Download Here](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
- Otherwise, making sure to properly follow setup. To test the Mongo databast locally, you can run it on `localhost`.

### Modifying The Bot
If you're familiar with the C# language, take some time to read through the layout of the project to understand how the bot works.
In it's current state, it's very easy to customize and add/remove to this bot.
If you add or remove commands, be sure to update that on the `help` command.
If you add or remove user info or inventory keys, or server keys, be sure to update the objects in `MongoUtil/`

### Setup
1. Fork or clone the latest version of this respository, or use the source code from the *releases* tab.
2. Compile the bot inside the root directory using `dotnet build`. The output will then appear in `bin/Debug/net5.0`.
3. Next, copy the `Storage` directory into the `net5.0` folder, the bot requires that folder.
4. Update `net5.0/Storage/config.toml` with the API keys and IDs required inside the file.
   - Required: `DiscordToken`, `UserID`, `MongoURL`, `DeveloperIDs`, `CacheDir`.
   - Optional: `EnableBotList`, `BotListToken`. (Only relevant if you're wanting to list your bot on Discord Bot List's website.)
5. Start your MongoDB server and make sure to add these collections: `servers.info`, `users.info`, `users.inventory`.
6. Start the bot by opening `PrototonBot.exe`, or the command `./PrototonBot`.
